# Topic Classifier for `.txt` Files

A simple yet effective **Python script** that uses basic machine learning principles to **classify the topic of plain-text files**. Drop in a `.txt` file and let the script predict what itâ€™s about.

## Features

- Accepts any `.txt` file as input
- Predicts the **topic/category** of the text
- Uses basic machine learning concepts:
  - Bag of Words / TF-IDF
  - Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression (customizable)
- Trained on a small, curated dataset of labeled topics

## How It Works

1. **Load `.txt` file**
2. **Preprocess**: remove stopwords, punctuation, tokenize, etc.
3. **Vectorize**: convert words to numerical features
4. **Classify**: predict the topic based on trained model
5. **Output**: print or save the prediction
