february 17 today marks t
he birth date of freem fr
eem, of dubhe iv, perhaps
 the most celebrated chil
d prodigy in musical hist
ory. though it is, of cou
rse, true that he appeare
d in no concerts after th
e age of twelve, none who
 have seen the solidograp
hs of his early performan
ces can ever forget the i
ntent face, the tense, ac
curate motions of the han
ds, the utter perfection 
of freem's entire perform
ance. his first concert, 
given at the age of four,
 was an amazing spectacle
. respected critics refus
ed to believe that freem 
was as young as his manag
er an octopoid from fomal
haut claimed, and were sa
tisfied only by the sworn
 affidavit of glerk, the 
well-known sirian, who wa
s present at the prelimin
ary interviews. being a s
irian, glerk was naturall
y incapable of dissimulat
ion, and his earnest supe
rsonics soon persuaded th
e critics of the truth. f
reem was, in actuality, o
nly four years old. in th
e next eight years, freem
 concertized throughout t
he galaxy. his triumph on
 deneb at the age of six,
 the stellar reception gi
ven him by a deputation o
f composers and critics f
rom the lesser magellanic
 cloud when he appeared i
n that sector, and the in
troduction as an encore o
f his single composition,
 the beloved memories of 
old age, are still recall
ed. and then, at the age 
of eleven, freem's concer
ts ceased. music-lovers t
hroughout the galaxy were
 stunned by the news that
 their famed prodigy woul
d appear no longer. at th
e age of twelve, freem fr
eem was dead. terrans hav
e never felt this loss as
 deeply as other galactic
 races, and it is not dif
ficult to see why. the st
andard year of dubhe iv e
quals 300 earth years to 
the short-lived terrans, 
freem freem had given his
 first concert at the age
 of 1200, and had died at
 the ripe old age of 3600
 years. calling a 1200-ye
ar-old being a child prod
igy, states the terran di
ctionary of music and mus
icians, rather tartly, is
 the kind of misstatement
 up with which we shall n
ot put. particularly note
worthy is the parallel at
titude expressed by the i
nhabitants of terk i, who
se year is approximately 
three terran days, to the
 alleged short life of wo
lfgang amadeus mozart. ma
y 12 wilrik rotha rotha d
elk shkulma tik was born 
on this date in 8080. alt
hough heshe is renowned b
oth as the creator of sym
phonic music on wolf xvi 
and as the progenitor of 
the sole galactic censors
hip law which remains in 
effect in this enlightene
d age, very little is act
ually known about the his
tory of that law.the full
 story is, very roughly, 
as follows in 8257, a com
position was published by
 the firm of scholer and 
dichs sirius, the concert
o for wood-block and orch
estra by tik. since this 
was not only the first ap
pearance of any compositi
on by tik, but was in fac
t the first composition o
f any kind to see publica
tion from his planet of w
olf xvi, the musical worl
d was astonished at the p
ower, control and mastery
 the piece showed. a revi
ew which is still extant 
stated it is not possible
 that a composition of su
ch a high level of organi
zation should be the firs
t to proceed from a compo
ser--or from an entire pl
anet. yet we must recogni
ze the merit and worth of
 tik's concerto, and appl
aud the force of the comp
oser, in a higher degree 
than usual. even more ama
zing than the foregoing w
as the speed with which t
ik's compositions followe
d one another. the concer
to was followed by a sona
ta, tik's tock, hisher fr
ee-fall ballet for centip
edals, lights action comr
ades, a symphony, an imbr
oglio for unstrung violin
, and fourteen wolfish rh
apsodies--all within the 
year scholars visited wol
f xvi and reported once a
gain that there was no mu
sical history on the plan
et. success, fame and mon
ey were tik's. succeeding
 compositions were receiv
ed with an amount of enth
usiasm that would have do
ne credit to any musician
. and wolf xvi seemed to 
awaken at hisher touch. w
ithin ten years, there wa
s a school of composition
 established there, and w
orks of astounding comple
xity and beauty came pour
ing forth. the great flow
ering, as it was called, 
seemed to inspire other p
lanets as well--to name o
nly a few, dog xii, golds
tone ix and trent ii whos
e inhabitants, dwelling u
nderwater for the most pa
rt, had never had anythin
g like a musical history.
 tik's own income began t
o go down as the process 
continued. then the aston
ishing truth was discover
ed. tik was not a compose
r at all--merely an elect
ronics technician heshe h
ad recorded the sounds of
 the planet's main downto
wn business center and sl
owed the recording to hal
f-speed. since the inhabi
tants of wolf xvi convers
e in batlike squeals, thi
s slowing resulted in a s
eries of patterns which f
ell within sonic range, a
nd which had all of the s
cope and the complexity o
f music itself. the other
 planets had copied the t
rick and soon the galaxy 
was glutted with this ele
ctronic music. the climax
 came when a judge on pao
lo iii aided in the recor
ding of a court trial ove
r which he presided. duri
ng the two weeks of subso
nic testimony, speech and
 bustle, he supervised re
cording apparatus and, in
 fact, announced that he 
had performed the actual 
arrangement involved spee
ding up the recordings so
 that the two-week subson
ic trial became a half-ho
ur fantasia. the judge lo
st the subsequent electio
n and irrationally placed
 the blame on the recordi
ng which had not been wel
l-received by the critics
. single-handed, he resto
red the state of pure mus
ic by pushing through the
 galactic assembly a cens
orship rule requiring tha
t all recording companies
, musicians, technicians 
and composers be limited 
to the normal sonic range
 of the planet on which t
hey were working. tik him
self, after the passage o
f this law, eked out a ba
re living as a translator
 from the supersonic. he

closed harp stirs reflect
ions in musical minds of 
the inventor and first vi
rtuoso on this instrument
, the ingenious barsak gh
. therwent of canopus xii
. nowadays, with composit
ions for that instrument 
as common as the chadlas 
of gh. therwent's home pl
anet, we are likely to pa
ss over the startling and
 almost accidental circum
stance that led to his ma
rvelous discovery. as a s
mall boy, gh. therwent wa
s enamored of music and m
usicians he played the gl
eep-flute before the age 
of eight and, using his h
air-thin minor arms, was 
an accomplished performer
 on the irish or small op
en harp in his fifteenth 
year. a tendency to confu
se the strings of the har
p with his own digital ex
tremities, however, seeme
d serious enough to rule 
out a concert career for 
the young flalk, and when
 an earth-made piano was 
delivered to the home of 
a neighbor who fancied hi
mself a collector of baro
que instruments, young gh
. was among the first to 
attempt playing on it. un
fortunately, he could not
 muster pressure sufficie
nt in his secondary arms 
and digits to depress the
 keys more, he kept slipp
ing between them. it was 
one such slip that led to
 his discovery of the enc
losed strings at the back
 of the piano a spinet. t
he subtle sonorities of p
lucked strings at the bac
k of a closed chamber exc
ited him, and he continue
d research into the instr
ument in a somewhat more 
organized manner. soon he
 was able to give a conce
rt of music which he hims
elf had arranged--and whe
n wladislaw wladislaw ded
icated his composition to
 gh., the performer's fut
ure was assured. the rest
 of his triumphant story 
is too well known to repe
at here. the single obser
vation on gh. therwent's 
playing, however, by the 
composer ratling, is perh
aps worthy of note. he do
n't play on the white key

lack of grammar which mad

he hrrshtk notes were dis
covered in a welf-shop ce
llar on deneb iii. these 
notes are, quite certainl
y, alone in their origina
lity, and in the force wh
ich they have had on the 
growth of subsequent musi
cians. to begin at the be
ginning it is well establ
ished that ludwig hrrshtk
, perhaps the most widely
 known denebian composer,
 died of overwork in his 
prime. his compositions, 
until the famous t85 disc
overies of g'g rash, were
 almost alone in their un
iversal appeal. races the
 galaxy over have thrille
d to hrrshtk's second sym
phony, his concerto for o
ld men, and the inspiring
 classic mambo suite. it 
is, as a matter of fact, 
said that g'g rash himsel
f was led to his discover
y by considering the ques
tion how can many differe
nt races, experiencing to
tally different emotions 
in totally different ways
, agree on the importance
 of a single musical comp
osition by hrrshtk how ca
n all share a single emot
ional experience his rese
arches delved deeply into
 the hrrshtk compositions
, and a tentative theory 
based on the most common 
harmonic, now shown to ha
ve been totally mistaken,
 led to the t85 discoveri
es. the hrrshtk notes, ho
wever, found long afterwa
rd, provide the real answ
er. among a pile of sketc
hes and musical fragments
 was found a long list--o
r, rather, a series of li
sts. in the form of a gal
actic dictionary, the pap
er is divided into many c
olumns, each headed with 
the name of a different p
lanet. rather than descri
be this document, we are

09, treth schmaltar died 
on his home planet of wel
lington v. all the galaxy
 knows his famous symphon
ic storm suite less known
, but equally interesting
, is the history and deve
lopment of its solo instr
ument. the natives of wel
lington v feed on airborn
e plankton, which is carr
ied by the vibrations of 
sound or speech. this was
 a little-known fact for 
many years, but did accou
nt for the joy with which
 the first explorers on w
ellington v were greeted.
 their speech created wav
es that fed the natives. 
when eating, the natives 
emit a strange humming no
ise, due to the action of
 the peculiar glottis. th
ese facts drove the first
 settlers, like treth sch
maltar, to the invention 
of a new instrument. this
 was a large drumlike con
struction with a small ho
le in its side through wh
ich airborne plankton cou
ld enter. inside the drum
, a wellingtonian crouche
d. when the drum was beat
en, the air vibrations dr
ove plankton into the nat
ive's mouth, and he ate a
nd hummed. a mechanical d
evice has since replaced 
the native. this is, of c
ourse, due to the terrifi
c expense of importing bo
th natives and plankton t
o other planets than well
ington v for concerts. th
us, a peculiarity of nati

0 the victimization of th
e swanlike inhabitants of
 harsh xii, perhaps the m
ost pitiful musical scand
al of the ages, was begun
 by ferd pill, born on th
is date in 8181. pill, wh
o died penitent in a neut
erary of the benedictine 
order, is said to have co
nceived his idea after pe
rusing some early terran 
legends about the swan. h
e never represented himse
lf as the composer, but a
lways as the agent or rep
resentative of a harsh xi
i inhabitant. in the shor
t space of three years, h
e sold over two hundred s
ongs, none of great lengt
h but all, as musicians a
gree to this day, of a st
artling and almost un-hna
u-like beauty. when a cle
rk in the records departm
ent of pill's publishers 
discovered that pill, hav
ing listed himself as the
 heir of each of the hars
h xii composers, was in f
act collecting their mone
y, an investigation began
. that the composers were
 in fact dead was easily 
discovered. that pill was
 their murderer was the n
ext matter that came to l
ight. in an agony of self
-abasement, pill confesse
d his crime. the harshian
s don't sing at all, he s
aid. they don't make a so
und. but--like the legend
ary swan of old terra--th
ey do deliver themselves 
of one song in dying. i m
urdered them in order to 
record these songs, and t
hen sold the recordings. 
pill's subsequent escape 
from the prison in which 
he was confined, and his 
trip to the sanctuary of 
the neuterary, were said 
to have been arranged by 
the grateful widow of one
 of the murdered harshian

r 5 today marks the birth
day of timmis calk, a sci
ence teacher of lavoris i
i. calk is almost forgott
en today, but his magnifi
cent student orchestra cr
eated a storm both of app
roval and protest when it
 was first seen in 9734. 
critics on both sides of 
what rapidly became a gal
axywide controversy were 
forced, however, to ackno
wledge the magnificent pl
aying of the student orch
estra and its great techn
ical attainments. its sto
ry begins with calk himse
lf and his sweetheart, a 
lovely being named silla.
 though calk's love for s
illa was true and profoun
d, silla did not return h
is affectionate feelings.
 she was an anti-scientis
t, a musician. the sects 
were split on lavoris ii 
to such an extent that ma
rriage between calk and h
is beloved would have mea
nt crossing the class lin
es--something which silla
, a music-lover, was unwi
lling to contemplate. cal
k therefore determined to
 prove to her that a scie
ntist could be just as ar
tistic as any musician. m
onths of hard work follow
ed, until finally he was 
ready. he engaged the gre
at drick hall for his fir
st concert--and the progr
am consisted entirely of 
classical works of great 
difficulty. beethoven's n
inth symphony opened the 
program, and fenk's rever
sed ode closed it. calk h
ad no time for the plaudi
ts of critics and audienc
e he went searching for s
illa. but he was too late
. she had heard his conce
rt--and had immediately a
ccepted the marriage prop
osal of a childhood sweet
heart. calk nearly commit
ted suicide. but at the l
ast moment, he tossed the
 spraying-bottle away and
 went back to silla. why 
he said. why did you reje
ct me, after hearing the 
marvelous music which i c
reated you are not a musi
cian, but a scientist, si
lla said. any musician wo
uld have refrained from g
rowing his orchestra from
 seeds. unable to underst
and her esthetic revulsio
n, calk determined there 
and then to continue his 
work with the student orc
hestra it made a great de
al more money than scienc
e-teaching. wrapping his 
rootlets around his branc
hes, he rolled away from 
her with crackling dignit
y.
