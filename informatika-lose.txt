when senator al gore was 
evangelizing support for 
his visionary national re
search and education netw
ork bill, he often pointe
d to the many benefits of
 a high-speed, multi-lane
, multi-level data superh
ighway. some of these inc
luded collaborating resea
rch teams, physically dis
tant from each other, wor
king on shared projects v
ia high speed computer ne
tworks. some of these gra
nd challenges might model
 global environmental cha
nge, or new therapeutic d
rug research, or the desi
gn of a new airplane for 
inexpensive consumer air 
travel. a scientist or en
gineer might design a pro
duct, which could be inst
antly communicated to a m
anufacturing plant, whose
 robotic machine could tu
rn the drawing-board prod
uct into reality. one exa
mple of this is the capab
ility to digitally measur
e a new recruit for an ar
my uniform, transmit the 
information to a clothing
 manufacturer, and take d
elivery of a custom-tailo
red uniform the next day.
 access to digital librar
ies of information, both 
textual and graphic. besi
des hundreds of online pu
blic access catalogs, and
 full text documents, col
or illustrations of photo
graphic quality, full mot
ion videos and digital au
dio will also be availabl
e over the network. in hi
s many articles and speec
hes touting the bill, gor
e often used an example o
f a little girl, living i
n a rural area, at work o
n a school project. was s
he information-poor due t
o her physical location, 
far from the resources of
 large cities no-- the na
tional research and educa
tion network would give h
er the capability to dial
 into the library of cong
ress-- to collect informa
tion on dinosaurs. now th
at the nren bill has been
 signed into law 1291, an
d committees are being fo
rmed, and policies are be
ing made, i'm still think
ing about that little gir
l, and her parents, for t
hat matter. in fact i've 
got some grand questions 
to pose.1- how will we ge
t access the internet has
 been called the interim 
nren, since it's what we 
have in place now. i'm wo
ndering how the family is
 going to get to the inte
rnet dial tone, let alone
 the nren, especially sin
ce they live in a rural a
rea. the information supe
rhighway may be miles fro
m their home, and it may 
be an expensive long-dist
ance call to the entrance
 ramp. or, the superhighw
ay may run right through 
their front yard, but the
y can't make use of it be
cause they have no comput
er, no modem, and no phon
e line to make the connec
tion. what good is a supe
rhighway if all you've go
t is a tricycle 2- what w
ill they be able to gain 
access to, and will their
 privacy be protected bey
ond the infrastructure is
sues, i'm concerned about
 what kind of things will
 be available for them on
ce they do get connected,
 how the resources will b
e arranged, and how they 
will learn to use these t
ools to advantage.  beyon
d that, how authoritative
 is the information in th
e digital collection, and
 how do we know for sure 
it came from a legitimate
 source how confidential 
will their information se
arches be, and how will i
t be safeguarded 3- who w
ill get access i'm concer
ned that even if the infr
astructure and resource p
roblems are resolved, tha
t little girl still won't
 be allowed access, becau
se a lot of folks don't t
hink the internet is a sa
fe place for unaccompanie
d minors. 4- does the fam
ily have any electronic r
ights electronic responsi
bilities are dinosaurs an
d a grade-school project 
too trivial for nren some
 people think the nren sh
ould be reserved for scie
ntists working on grand c
hallenges, not ordinary o
nes. who will decide what
 constitutes acceptable u
se 5- what is the future 
of the local public libra
ry worse yet, i'm worried
 that the reason they are
 phoning the library of c
ongress in the first plac
e is that their local pub
lic library has shut its 
doors, sold off the book 
stock, and dismissed the 
librarian. what can publi

c library is a good place
 for nren access the publ
ic library is an institut
ion based on long-standin
g beliefs in intellectual
 freedom and the individu
al's right to know. let's
 revisit ala's library bi
ll of rights, adopted jun
e 18, 1948 amended februa
ry 2, 1961, and january 2
3, 1980, by the ala counc
il. the american library 
association affirms that 
all libraries are forums 
for information and ideas
, and that the following 
basic policies should gui
de their services. 1.  bo
oks and other library res
ources should be provided
 for the interest, inform
ation, and enlightenment 
of all people of the comm
unity the library serves.
  materials should not be
 excluded because of the 
origin, background, or vi
ews of those contributing
 to their creation. no pr
oblem here. the internet'
s resources are as divers
e as their creators, from
 nations all over the wor
ld. every community can f
ind something of interest
 on the internet. 2.  lib
raries should provide mat
erials and information pr
esenting all points of vi
ew on current and histori
cal issues. materials sho
uld not be proscribed or 
removed because of partis
an or doctrinal disapprov
al. 3.  libraries should 
challenge censorship in t
he fulfillment of their r
esponsibility to provide 
information and enlighten
ment. 4.  libraries shoul
d cooperate with all pers
ons and groups concerned 
with resisting abridgment
 of free expression and f
ree access to ideas. agai
n, global electronic comm
unication allows discussi
on and debate in an insta
nt electronic forum. ther
e is no better reality ch
eck than this. 5.  a pers
on's right to use a libra
ry should not be denied o
r abridged because of ori
gin, age, background, or 
views. in a public librar
y, the little girl won't 
be barred from using the 
internet because of her a
ge. the ala interpretatio
n of the above right stat
es librarians and governi
ng bodies should not reso
rt to age restrictions on
 access to library resour
ces in an effort to avoid
 actual or anticipated ob
jections from parents or 
anyone else.  the mission
, goals, and objectives o
f libraries do not author
ize librarians or governi
ng bodies to assume, abro
gate, or overrule the rig
hts and responsibilities 
of parents or legal guard
ians.  librarians and gov
erning bodies should main
tain that parents - and o
nly parents - have the ri
ght and the responsibilit
y to restrict the access 
of their children - and o
nly their children - to l
ibrary resources. parents
 or legal guardians who d
o not want their children
 to have access to certai
n library services, mater
ials or facilities, shoul
d so advise their childre
n. librarians and governi
ng bodies cannot assume t
he role of parents or the
 functions of parental au
thority in the private re
lationship between parent
 and child.  librarians a
nd governing bodies have 
a public and professional
 obligation to provide eq
ual access to all library
 resources for all librar
y users. 6.  libraries wh
ich make exhibit spaces a
nd meeting rooms availabl
e to the public they serv
e should make such facili
ties available on an equi
table basis, regardless o
f the beliefs or affiliat
ions of individuals or gr
oups requesting their use
. the internet provides t
he equivalent of electron
ic meeting rooms and virt
ual exhibit spaces. publi
c libraries will offer ac
cess to all comers, regar
dless of their status. fu
rther, as part of the int
erpretation of the librar
y bill of rights, this st
atement appears the u.s. 
supreme court has recogni
zed that the right to rec
eive ideas follows ineluc
tably from the sender's f
irst amendment right to s
end them. . . . more impo
rtantly, the right to rec
eive ideas is a necessary
 predicate to the recipie
nt's meaningful exercise 
of his own rights such as
 speech, press, and polit
ical freedom' board of ed
ucation, island trees uni

 opinion. clearly, recept
ion and sending of ideas 
is a first amendment issu
e. oral, written, and ele
ctronic speech must be eq
ually protected so that d
emocracy may flourish. pu
blic libraries also provi
de free services, though 
in fact the costs are jus
t deferred. taxes, state 
aid derived from taxes, f
ederal aid derived from t
axes, and private funds a
ll pay for the free servi
ces at public libraries. 
public libraries may be t
hought of as information 
management organizations 
imo's, similar to health 
management organizations,
 where patronspatients co
ntribute before they need
 informationhealth care, 
so that when they do need
 it, librariansdoctors ar
e available to render aid
.why nren in the public l
ibrary is a bad idea on t
he surface, the public li
brary looks like an excel
lent place to drop intern
etnren connectivity. libr
aries are veritable templ
es of learning, intellect
ual freedom, and confiden
tiality. however, most pu
blic libraries lack what 
computer experts call inf
rastructure. if there are
 computers, they may be o
ut of date. staff may not
 have had time to learn t
o operate them, and the c
omputers may literally be
 collecting dust. there m
ay be no modems, no phone
 line to share, no staff 
with time to learn about 
the internet and its many
 resources.  money to upd
ate equipment, hire staff
, and buy training is out
 of the question. public 
libraries face slashed bu
dgets, staff layoffs, red
uced hours, and cutbacks 
in services. many of thes
e drawbacks are noted in 
the recent study by dr. c
harles r. mcclure, called
 public libraries and the
 internetnren new challen
ges, new opportunities. p
ublic librarians were sur
veyed about their attitud
es toward nren in intervi
ews and focus groups. acc
ording to the study, publ
ic librarians thought tha
t the public had a right 
to the internet, and its 
availability in their lib
raries would provide a sa
fety net for the electron
ic-poor. on the other han
d they felt that they cou
ld not commit resources t
o this initiative until t
hey knew better what the 
costs were and the benefi
ts might be. they longed 
for someone else to creat
e a pilot project to demo
nstrate the internet's us
efulness, or lack thereof
, for public library user
s. the study describes se
veral scenarios for publi
c libraries as the nren e
volves. some may simply c
hoose to ignore the sweep
ing technological changes
 in information transfer.
 they may continue to exi
st by purveying high-dema
nd items and traditional 
services, but they may fi
nd it increasingly diffic
ult to maintain funding l
evels as the rest of the 
world looks elsewhere for
 their information and re
ference needs. the public
 library may find itself 
servicing only the inform
ation disenfranchised, wh
ile the rest of the commu
nity finds, and pays for,
 other solutions.as the s
tudy explains while embra
cing and exploiting netwo
rked information and serv
ices, successfully transi
tioned libraries also mai
ntain high visibility and
 high demand traditional 
services. but resources w
ill be reallocated from c
ollections and less-visib
le services to support th
eir involvement in the ne
twork. all services will 
be more client-centered a
nd demand-based, and the 
library will consciously 
seek opportunities to del
iver new types of informa
tion resources and servic
es electronically. in thi
s scenario, the public li
brary will develop and mo
unt services over the nre
n, provide for public acc
ess to the nren, and will
 compete successfully aga
inst other information pr
oviders. in its networked
 role, the library can se
rve as a central point of
 contact as an electronic
 navigator and intermedia
ry in linking individuals
 to electronic informatio
n resources- regardless o
f type or physical locati
on. the public library in
 this second scenario wil
l define a future for its
elf in the nren and devel
op a strategic plan to in
sure its successful parti
cipation as an informatio
n provider in the network
ed environment.what shoul
d happen senator gore has
 proposed what has been v
ariously called son of nr
en or gore ii, which shou
ld help address many of t
hese infrastructure probl
ems. unfortunately, the b
ill was not passed and th
e closing of the last con
gress. there is hope, how
ever, that it will be rei
ntroduced this spring. sp
ecifically, gore's bill w
ould have ensured that th
e technology developed by
 the high-performance com
puting act of 1991 is app
lied widely in k-12 educa
tion, libraries, health c
are and industry, particu
larly manufacturing.  it 
would have authorized a t
otal of 1.15 billion over
 the next five years. acc
ording to a press release
 from senator gore's offi
ce, the information infra
structure and technology 
act charges the white hou
se office of science and 
technology policy ostp wi
th coordinating efforts t
o develop applications fo
r high-performance comput
ing networking and assign
s specific responsibiliti
es to the national scienc
e foundation, the nationa
l aeronautics and space a
gency, the national insti
tute of standards and tec
hnology, and the national
 institutes of health. it
 would expand the role of
 ostp in overseeing feder
al efforts to disseminate
 scientific and technical
 information. the bill pr
ovides funding to both ns
f and nasa to develop tec
hnology for 'digital libr
aries'-- huge data bases 
that store text, imagery,
 video, and sound and are
 accessible over computer
 networks like nsfnet.  t
he bill also funds develo
pment of prototype 'digit
al libraries' around the 
country. the public needs
 nren because 300 baud us

patient waiting for fax m
achines to print out a do
cument from half a contin
ent away, when a few year
s ago we would have been 
content to wait days or w
eeks for the same article
 to arrive by mail. we ar
e satisfied with technolo
gy until it starts to imp
ede our lives in some way
. we wait impatiently, su
re that we spend half our
 lives waiting for printe
rs, and the other half wa
iting for disk drives. ti
me is a commodity. i can 
envision that little girl
 walking into the public 
library with the followin

deo clip of the explosion

lity mock-ups of the shut
tle interior. can you put
 it all on this floppy di
sk for me, i know it's on
ly 15 minutes before you 
close but, gee, i had ban
d practice.  this is why 
public libraries need nre
n. we would do well to re
member the words of ranga
nathan, whose basic tenet
s of good librarianship n
eed just a little updatin
g from 1931 information i

of the user. a network is
 a growing organism. and 
so is the public library.

 can be proactive rather 
than reactive to technolo
