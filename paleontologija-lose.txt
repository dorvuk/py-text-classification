escription.--the type con
sists of the preorbital a
nd interorbital parts of 
a skull. its size is comp
arable to that of the rec
ent heteromyid, liomys pi
ctus merriam. l. pictus i
s the species referred to
 in the comparisons below
 when only the generic na
me liomys is mentioned. b
oth incisors have been br
oken off. the right tooth
-row is missing, but the 
left row is complete, and
 its orientation indicate
s that the tooth rows wer
e parallel. the zygomata 
are broken off close to t
he rostrum, which is rela
tively narrow in comparis
on with its length and de
pth. in this narrowness, 
the specimen resembles fl
orentiamys wood more than
 it does such recent hete
romyids as liomys or hete
romys, where the rostrum 
is much wider at the dors
al surface than at the ve
ntral surface correlating
 with the wide interorbit
al dimension. in no. 7702
 the rostrum is not appre
ciably expanded on the do
rsal surface. the wide in
terorbital dimension also
 gives a tapering appeara
nce to the rostrum of the
 recent heteromyids, when
 viewed dorsally, which i
s not seen in the fossil 
specimen. like those of m
ost heteromyids, the nasa
ls and premaxillaries pro
ject forward beyond the i
ncisors. h. tenuiceps has
 a distinctly heteromyidl
ike appearance, and it is
 obvious that the feature
s of the anterior part of
 the skull, which charact
erize the heteromyids, ha
d been established by mid
dle oligocene time. the n
asal bone extends caudad 
as far as does the premax
illary they terminate at 
the anterior border of th
e orbit. the nasal is wid
est anteriorly where it c
urves downward on the sid
e to meet the anterior pr
ojection of the premaxill
ary bone beyond the incis
or. posteriorly, the two 
nasals have practically p
arallel lateral borders m
uch as in liomys. the fro
ntal bone dorsally is rel
atively narrower than in 
any recent heteromyid, an
d closely resembles that 
of the geomyids. there is
 a slight depression in t
he midline of the skull w
here the two frontals uni
te, but no evidence of a 
ridge for the attachment 
of the temporal muscle. i
n lateral view, the ledge
 seen in liomys at the do
rsal surface is absent, n
or is this surface rounde
d as in geomys. preservat
ion around the nasolacrim
al canal is poor, but tra
ces of sutures indicate t
hat the frontal bone is n
ot involved in the poster
omedial wall of that cana
l. the orbital plate is b
road, comparatively flat,
 and extends farther vent
rad than in liomys, and e
nters into the compositio
n of the sphenopalatine f
oramina. ventrally the fr
ontal bone meets the orbi
tal processes of the pala
tine and maxillary bones,
 and posterolaterally mee
ts the orbitosphenoid. in
 the anterodorsal angle o
f the rim of the orbit th
e lacrimal bone rests aga
inst the frontal and maxi
llary bones, where the bo
dy of the lacrimal contri
butes to the formation of
 the posteromedial wall o
f the nasolacrimal canal.
 only a slight part of th
e maxillary process of th
e lacrimal remains on eac
h side. the premaxillary 
bone, which constitutes m
ost of the anterior part 
of the rostrum, is typica
lly heteromyid in shape. 
the frontal process is lo
ng and slender. on the si
de of the rostrum the pre
maxillary forms the anter
ointernal border of the i
nfraorbital foramen. the 
ventrolateral border of t
he bone is expanded sligh
tly and aids in the forma
tion of the tuberosity ma
de by the maxillary bone 
at the ventroposterior bo
rder of the foramen. vent
rally the premaxillary ma
kes up the anterior two-t
hirds of the lateral wall
 of the incisive anterior
 palatine foramen. it is 
not possible to establish
 what part of the median 
septum between the forami
na is made up of premaxil
lary bones. the incisor a
rches through the premaxi
llary in a manner similar
 to that in liomys, with 
the upper wall of the roo
t canal being formed by t
he upper surface of the b
one. due to the narrownes
s of the rostrum, the roo
t of the incisor is promi
nently outlined on the si
de of the rostrum, both i
n the premaxillary and ma
xillary bones. with this 
modeling of the side of t
he rostrum because of the
 incisor root canal, and 
the flaring of the poster
ior and ventral edges of 
the infraorbital foramen,
 the side wall of the pre
maxillary appears as a de
pressed area. anterior to
 the incisor root the tip
 of the premaxillary proj
ects forward, and paralle
ls its opposite, laterall
y, instead of turning inw
ard as in liomys. this co
ndition, together with th
e prominence of the root 
canal, makes the anterior
 tip project as a flange.
 the premaxillary extends
 downward as a plate of b
one, and embraces the pos
terior and lateral sides 
of the incisor as in rece
nt heteromyids. the inter
premaxillary foramen, if 
present, is obscure. howe
ver, there appears to be 
a foramen posterior to th
e incisor, which possibly
 has taken over the funct
ion of the interpremaxill
ary foramen. both maxilla
ry bones are incomplete, 
and lack the zygomatic pr
ocesses. the rostral part
 of the maxillary is comp
ressed laterally, as is t
he premaxillary. the ante
rior border of the maxill
ary contributes to the fo
rmation of the border of 
the anterior opening of t
he infraorbital canal whe
re, at the posteroventral
 border of the opening, t
he bone is produced into 
a prominent tuberosity wh
ich projects laterally ap
proximately one millimete
r on each side. the infra
orbital foramen anterior 
opening of the infraorbit
al canal lies about midwa
y between the anterior en
d of the skull and the ro
ot of the zygoma. high on
 each side of the rostrum
, and beneath the dorsal 
edge of the masseteric pl
ate, is an area containin
g small foramina. the zyg
omasseteric plate is incl
ined forward at the dorsa
l end, and extends anteri
orly almost to the highes
t part of the arch of the
 canal for the root of th
e incisor. the posterior 
end of the infraorbital c
anal lies on the median s
ide of the zygomatic root
 as it does in h. hatcher
i wood. ventrally the zyg
omatic root rises above t
he fourth premolar as in 
h. gregoryi wood, h. hatc
heri, and in recent heter
omyids. the ventral part 
of the orbit, containing 
the sphenopalatine forame
n, presphenoid foramen, a
nd the sphenoidal fissure
, is not constricted as i
n liomys, but is open lik
e that of the squirrels. 
this condition is emphasi
zed by the narrowness of 
the interorbital part of 
the skull and the more ve
rtical position of the or
bital plate. the alisphen
oid bone is large and for
ms part of the posteromed
ial wall of the orbit. th
e sphenofrontal foramen l
ies in the suture between
 the extreme anterior mar
gin of this bone and the 
frontal bone. the orbitos
phenoid bone makes up lit
tle of the orbital wall. 
it occupies the posterior
 area of the orbit betwee
n the alisphenoid and pal
atine, and is in contact 
with these bones and the 
frontal. the presphenoid 
canal between the orbits 
is large, and the entranc
e at each end is well sep
arated from the sphenoida
l fissure. damage to the 
sphenoidal fissure, which
 occurred prior to preser
vation, obscures its rela
tionship to the optic for
amen. no bar was found th
at would indicate that th
e two openings were widel
y separate. anteroventral
ly the sphenoidal fissure
 is bounded by the orbito
sphenoid bone, and dorsol
aterally by the alispheno
id bone. between the pres
phenoid foramen and the o
rbitosphenoid-frontal sut
ure there is a distinct r
idge, and the suture betw
een the two bones lies in
 an elongate pit or troug
h formed by the anterior 
sloping side of the ridge
 and the impressed latera
l wall of the frontal bon
e. the palatine bone is r
epresented by fragments j
oined to other bones of t
he skull. the maxillary p
rocess of the left palati
ne bone is united to the 
maxillary by a highly sin
uous suture. the union of
 the palatines to the max
illaries make a suture in
 the shape of a v with th
e base forward and somewh
at blunt. the canal for t
he palatine artery and ne
rve has a multiple openin
g on the palate. one majo
r foramen opens on each s
ide of the palatomaxillar
y suture, and two or poss
ibly three smaller forami
na open posteriorly on th
e palatine bone. prominen
t on the palatine bone, p
osteromedial to the third
 molar, is the foramen pa
latine pit for the palati
ne vein. collectively, th
is complex of foramina is
 often known as the poste
rior palatine foramina. w
ood 1933 states that h. g
regoryi has two posterior
 palatine foramina as in 
recent genera, the anteri
or one opening opposite t
he posterior end of m1, a
nd the posterior one oppo
site the median part of m
3. the orbital process of
 the left palatine bone l
ies inside medial to the 
palatine process of the m
axillary. anteriorly this
 orbital process meets th
e orbital process of the 
maxillary bone, and the s
phenopalatine foramen is 
found in the suture betwe
en these two bones and th
e frontal. as previously 
mentioned, the preserved 
dentition of this specime
n consists of the complet
e left row of cheek teeth
 and roots of the incisor
s. the incisor is compres
sed laterally, more so th
an in any recent heteromy
id. the anterior face is 
rounded, asulcate, and co
vered with a heavy band o
f enamel, whereas the pos
terior side, due to later
al compression, is drawn 
out into a thin blade. th
e root of the incisor is 
at the lateral border of 
the premaxillary, so it i
s obvious that the two in
cisors converged on each 
other at the midline to f
orm a cutting surface. th
e writer has not examined
 the asulcate, laterally 
compressed incisors of h.
 hatcheri, and cannot say
 how they compare with th
is specimen. the most sig
nificant features of the 
cheek teeth are their siz
e, and the undivided inte
rnal cingulum. the molars
 are well worn, but the p
attern, as a whole, is ea
sily discernable. p4 has 
an anterior cusp and thre
e posterior cusps as in o
ther members of the genus
. however, the buccal cus
p metacone of the metalop
h is considerably anterio
r to the central hypocone
 and lingual entostyle cu
sps, and the three cusps 
do not form a curve as in
 other species. in size t
he central cusp is larges
t, the buccal cusp is pra
ctically as large, and th
e lingual cusp is small. 
a cingulum connects the l
ingual and central cusps 
at the posterior margin o
f the tooth. in the pipes
tone springs specimen of 
heliscomys reported by mc
grew 1941 the central and
 buccal cusps were connec
ted by a cingulum, and so
me h. hatcheri specimens 
have all three cusps conn
ected in a similar manner
. a low arm or ridge exte
nds from the lingual cusp
 forward to the lingual s
ide of the base of the an
terior cusp. the valleys 
between the posterior cus
ps are shallow. there is 
no sign of the small cusp
ule on the anteroexternal
 base of the anterior cus
p seen in h. gregoryi, h.
 hatcheri, and the pipest
one springs specimen. how
ever, when one sees the v
ariability of the cuspule
s on p4 of h. hatcheri, t
he presence of a minor cu
spule does not seem to be
 of taxonomic importance.
m1 deviates from the patt
ern typical of heliscomys
 more than do any of the 
other molar teeth. howeve
r, it must be kept in min
d that some of the differ
ences may be due to wear.
 for example, the protoco
ne and paracone, and the 
hypocone and metacone are
 united to form protoloph
 and metaloph respectivel
y. if the height of the e
xternal border of the par
acone and metacone is tak
en into account and compa
red with the worn inner p
arts of these two cusps a
nd the equally well-worn 
protocone and hypocone, i
t appears that these cusp
s formed no more of a tru
e bilophodont tooth than 
do the cusps in other spe
cies of heliscomys in eac
h of the species the cusp
s generally are separate 
entities. h. gregoryi is 
reported to have an incip
ient tendency to form lop
hs, and h. hatcheri does 
the same when worn, but b
y union with the anterior
 cingulum. if cusps in h.
 tenuiceps do form lophs,
 the process is definitel
y not by union of the cus
ps with the anterior cing
ulum. the transverse medi
an valley is deep and div
ides the tooth on the buc
cal side. the anteroposte
rior valleys are shallow 
and hanging, and can be s
aid to exist only as inde
ntations between the two 
sets of cusps. the paraco
ne and metacone are much 
higher than the other two
 cusps, but much of this 
disparity in height may b
e the result of greater w
ear on the protocone and 
hypocone h. gregoryi agre
es with h. tenuiceps in t
hese respects. possibly t
he protocone and hypocone
 were much larger than th
e paracone and metacone. 
the internal cingulum of 
m1 exhibits only one larg
e cusp opposite the media
l end of the transverse v
alley, and shows no evide
nce of having been divide
d into two cusps. it is b
arely possible that there
 may have been two cusps 
and that wear makes it ap
pear that there was only 
one. i doubt that there w
ere two cusps because the
 cingulum is still so hig
h as high as the outer ed
ges of the paracone and m
etacone as to suggest tha
t it is only slightly wor
n. posteriorly this singl
e cusp in the cingulum is
 united with the hypocone
. anteriorly the cusp is 
confluent with an anterio
r cingulum that is small,
 but, nevertheless, plain
ly visible as it crosses 
the occlusal face of the 
tooth to the paracone. th
ere is some reason to bel
ieve that there was a pos
terior cingulum, but wear
, which has obliterated e
ven the posterior wall of
 the hypocone, prevents m
y being certain about thi
s. this cingulum is absen
t in h. gregoryi and pres
ent in h. hatcheri. m2 co
mpares favorably with m1 
except for the following 
differences the protocone
 and hypocone are equal t
o the paracone and metaco
ne in area, but not in he
ight although the interna
l cingulum is undivided, 
there is no evidence of a
 cusp as in m1. here, too
, the cingulum is as high
 as the paracone and meta
cone. possibly the cingul
um was confluent with the
 hypocone. the internal c
ingulum continues around 
the margin of the tooth t
o the paracone as an ante
rior cingulum which is sh
arper and plainer than th
e anterior cingulum on m1
. there is no evidence of
 a posterior cingulum. m3
 shows a great amount of 
wear, and the occlusal pa
ttern is not too clear. t
he median transverse vall
ey is reduced almost to a
 pit, and the paracone an
d metacone are divided by
 a small notch. the proto
cone and paracone, the la
tter being much higher, a
re larger than the metaco
ne which is reduced in si
ze, and not all this diff
erence in size can be the
 result of wear. the hypo
cone is absent. the inter
nal cingulum is as high a
s the paracone and shows 
no evidence of division i
nto two cusps, but in m3 
this character is apparen
tly variable for h. grego
ryi does not have the int
ernal cingulum divided an
d h. hatcheri has it mark
edly so. a slight anterio
r arm of the internal cin
gulum may have reached fo
rward to the anterior fac
e of the protocone. wear 
prevents knowing whether 
a crest surrounds the too
th completely, or only on
 three sides. in size the
 teeth of h. tenuiceps av
erage twenty per cent lar
ger than any of the upper
 teeth of h. gregoryi, h.
 hatcheri, or the pipesto
ne springs specimen, and 
exceed any of the known l
ower teeth including thos
e of h. vetus and h. sene
x by twenty-five per cent
 or more. inasmuch as the
 upper teeth rarely excee
d the lower in length in 
all the related genera of
 heteromyids, it is assum
ed that a similar relatio
nship existed between the
 upper and lower molars o
f h. tenuiceps and, there
fore, that this species c
an be distinguished by it
s large size. the relativ
e size of the premolars a
nd molars is the same in 
h. tenuiceps as in other 
species of heliscomys. ho
wever, within the framewo
rk of this similar relati
onship there are two diff
erences. p4 of h. tenuice
ps is relatively larger t
han the p4 of h. gregoryi
, and relatively smaller 
than the p4 of h. hatcher
i. the width of the molar
s is relatively greater i
